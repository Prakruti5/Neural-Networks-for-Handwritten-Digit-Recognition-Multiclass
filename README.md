An Introduction to Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition: Mastering Multiclass Classification
Multiclass classification is a key concept in machine learning, with applications ranging from handwritten digit recognition to object classification in photographs. 
We will enter into the realm of neural networks in this blog article and examine how multiclass classification, a technique, may be utilized to identify handwritten digits 0â€“9.
